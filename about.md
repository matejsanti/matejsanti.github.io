# Aims, contents and method of the course

The class will introduce the students to a variety of software tools and methods used in the Digital Humanities, primarily using the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is expected.

# Course Evaluation 

Course evaluation will be a combination of in-class participation (30%), weekly homework assignments (50%), and the collaborative final project (20%). 

# Class Participation

Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. BRING YOUR LAPTOP! We will accommodate whatever operating system you use, but it should be a laptop rather than a tablet. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation!

# Homework

Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what.

# Final Project

The final project will be done in small groups (3-4 students each). You choose a project to carry out that draws upon the tools and methods we cover in class, as well as their own strengths and field interests. You should choose your groups by the end of April, and describe your planned projects during the class session on the 15th of May. You will present and demonstrate your results during the final meeting on the 26th of June.
